# About Leaflet

Leaflet is an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. It is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and highly customizable.

## How Leaflet Works

1. Map Initialization: Leaflet begins with creating a map in a specified HTML element (typically a `<div>`).

2. Tile Layers: Leaflet displays maps by loading and displaying tile layers. These are images of map tiles at various zoom levels. You can use different tile providers to customize the appearance of the map.

3. Markers, Shapes, and Popups: You can add various elements to the map, such as:

    - Markers: Marks added to specific points.

    - Shapes: Like polygons, circles, and lines.

    - Popups: Small information boxes.

4. Events: Leaflet supports various user interaction events (such as click, mouseover) and methods to respond to events.

5. GeoJSON Support: Leaflet works well with GeoJSON data, allowing you to render geographical data layers onto the map.
